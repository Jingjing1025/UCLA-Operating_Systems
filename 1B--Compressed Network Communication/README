Included Files
==============
lab1b-client.c: 
The C program that opens a connection to a server (port specified with the mandatory
--port= command line parameter) rather than sending it directly to a shell. The client
then sends input from the keyboard to the socket (while echoing to the display), and
input from the socket to the display.

lab1b-server.c:
The C program that connects with the client, receive the client's commands and send them
to the shell, and "serves" the client the outputs of those commands.

Makefile:
The file that can be used to build the progrma and the tarball. It supports the
following four targets:
default: compile and build the two C programs
lab1b-client: compile the lab1b-client.c file
lab1b-server: compile the lab1b-server.c file
clean: remove all the files that are created by the Makefile
dist: build the distribution tarball

README:
The file that describes the details about the included files
