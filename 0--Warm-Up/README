Included Files
==============
lab0.c: 
The C program that can be used to copy its standard input to its standard
output. It accepts four optional arguments: 
--input=filename
	which uses the file as the standard input
--output=filename
	which uses the file as the standard output
--segfault
	which forces the segmentation fault with no copying step
--catch
	which catches the segmentation fault using signal and logs an error message

Makefile:
The file that can be used to build the progrma and the tarball. It supports the
following four targets:
default: compile and build the C program
check: use smoke-tests to test the specific features of the program
clean: remove all the files that are created by the Makefile, and return the 
directory to its freshly untared state
dist: build the distribution tarball

Smoke-test Cases
================
check_success
	checks if the program will exit with code 0 under successful cases
check_segfault
	checks if the program will exit with code 4 if there are segmentation faults caught
check_input
	checks if the program will exit with code 2 if the input file is failed to be opened
check_output
	checks if the program will exit with code 3 if the output file is failed to be created
check_argument
	checks if the program will exit with code 1 if the arguments are invalid
